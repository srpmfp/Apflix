<h1><span style="color: red;">Apflix </span></h1>

<i> Apflix</i> is an app that allows users to select their favorite movies through a list of curated movies. These movies allow for users to filter by Searching through titles, selecting through a list of genres. 

 To begin,  the login-view allows you to either login with your information or select the sign-up button. Once you have followed the prompts created your account and/or logged in, you are greated with the list of current movies within the database. Use the text input to search for movies within the app.

 You can then select the movie card and be taken to the move-view screen where information about the movie is held. You can add this movie to your favorites by selecting "add" at the top of the card.

 You can view your profile by going to the navigation bar and selecting "Profile". In the profile view, the list of all the selected movies and the login info will be present. You can update this information using the button at the very top "Update Info".

## Future State Goals

1. desaturation for movie cards already in favorites list
2. user ratings of movies to be averaged with other users
3. if a user hasn't seen a movie, a new list of movies they'd like to see, or ones they have zero interest in seeing
4. quality of life changes: 
- filter swaps immediately to new genre.
- sign-up also immediate logs in once completed
- sizing of every card in the main-view is the same.
- remove blue underline in movie card
- center the movie-view cards completely
- dropdown button instead of individual genre buttons
- lag in search field--needs two inputted characters.
